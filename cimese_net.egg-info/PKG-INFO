Description: Using a set of high quality films and lower quality recordings of those films, individual frames were extracted and a training set of image triplets was developed. Using the VGG16 convolutional neural net (as implemented in Keras), each frame was encoded as a vector of length 4096. Using this as the input to a new set of top layers, a classifier was created that would output the probability that the two images were a match or not. In addition, a means of aligning the clip with the full film is available to optimize the neural net performance. The output is a single infringement probability averaged over the length of the potentially infringing clip.
